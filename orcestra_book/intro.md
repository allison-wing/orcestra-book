# The ORCESTRA campaign

**ORCESTRA - Organized Convection and EarthCARE Studies over the Tropical Atlantic**


```{admonition} Overall objectives of the ORCESTRA campaign
:class: tip
1. Determine the drivers of mesoscale organisation in the tropics and their impact on smallscale weather systems and the large scale circulation with a particular focus on the structure and variability of the Atlantic ITCZ
2. Serve as a benchmark for satellite remote sensing and a new generation of high resolution storm resolving models
```

## Date and Location

ORCESTRA took place from August 10 to September 30, 2024 in the tropical Atlantic region.

ORCESTRA is an international initiative that combines eight different sub-campaigns, which are listed in the [ORCESTRA overview](orcestra.md) page. This book further includes information on the science, the (measurement) strategy, preparations (e.g. the virtual field campaign), and all around [data](data.md). Available data is listed in the [data browser](https://browser.orcestra-campaign.org/).
