### Data Browser

The [**ORCESTRA Data Browser**](https://browser.orcestra-campaign.org) is a low-threshold entry point to explore the ORCESTRA datasets currently available via [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/ipns/latest.orcestra-campaign.org/products/).

The data browser retrieves all information on-demand from the metadata in the datasets. In order for the data browser to correctly identify and parse relevant information, we have created the [ORCESTRA attribute convention](attribute_convention.md).
