### Data Browser

The [**ORCESTRA Data Browser**](https://browser.orcestra-campaign.org) is a low-threshold entry point to explore the ORCESTRA datasets currently available via [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/ipns/latest.orcestra-campaign.org/products/).

The data browser retrieves all information on-demand from the metadata in the datasets. In order for the data browser to correctly identify and parse relevant information, we have created the [ORCESTRA attribute convention](attribute_convention.md).

### Supporting data
#### Numerical simulations - Limited area model

To support the campaign, we performed daily hindcasts of the atmospheric conditions in the campaign region. The whole dataset is stored on the supercomputer [Levante](https://docs.dkrz.de/doc/levante/index.html) hosted by the DKRZ and is accessible on demand. It comprises of high-sampling rate 2D and 3D snapshots of key variables.

Visualisations of individual variables for each day are given [here](lam.md). An example of such a visualisation is shown below.
