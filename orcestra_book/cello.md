```{admonition} Overall objectives of the CELLO campaign
:class: tip
1. Provide in-situ calibration and validation (cal/val) data for the EarthCARE mission scientists and product development team in a range of cloudy environments and temperature regimes.
2. Collocate the EarthCARE correlative observations with overflights of ground-based remote sensing sites whenever possible.
```
The collocations with the ground-based remote sensing sites will ultimately provide a much more comprehensive cal/val dataset than ascertainable by any single measurement platform. 

CELLO is a Norwegian initiative that uses the Romanian [INCAS King Air](https://www.eufar.net/aircrafts/86) research aircraft to perform calibration and validation (cal/val) flights to quantify the quality of ESA’s/JAXA’s [EarthCARE](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/earthcare) (Cloud, Aerosol, and Radiation Explorer) satellite. EarthCARE (launched in May 2024) offers the unique and powerful collocation of an atmospheric lidar, cloud profiling radar, multi-spectral imager and broadband radiometer to provide unprecedented data sets to advance our understanding of the role of clouds in the climate system. To fulfill EarthCARE’s mission objectives, cal/val efforts are of paramount importance to characterize and quality-check its cloud products.

## Capabilities and coordination

The King Air aircraft is equipped with in-situ cloud probes enabling us to observe cloud droplets and ice crystals over a wide range of sizes. Our aim is to characterize the microphysical properties of clouds at different stages of convection around Cape Verde during multiple EarthCARE overpasses in August and September 2024. Joining the international efforts within the ORCESTRA consortium will provide a unique observational setup with two in-situ aircraft (INCAS King Air, French SAFIRE ATR-42), one remote sensing aircraft (German HALO), and a research vessel (German METEOR). We aim to capitalize from the coordination of the different platforms to increase the spatial and temporal representativeness of the cal/val observations during EarthCARE overpasses.
